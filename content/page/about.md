# Who is Brad Cypert?
**I’m passionate about Flutter, Rust, Go, and Software Architecture.**  
**I’m also passionate about being passionate about things.**

#### From the Beginning

I started writing my first bits of ‘code’ playing a game called Anarchy Online. The game offered a neat scripting system and a HTML rendering engine that was way ahead of it’s time. After realizing how cool that was, I took some Java classes in highschool. After realizing how cool THAT was, I decided to make a career out of it, pursuing it through college and self-education. Now, I openly seek out opportunities to educate others and further my own education.

#### Languages & Tools

I can list dozens of languages that I can “Hello World” in, but I’m not going to. Instead, I’ll tell you that I’m currently focusing most of my efforts on Rust, Go, and Dart at this time. Particularly, I'm learning Rust, writing Go when it makes sense and looking to grow Dart's developer ecosystem. Help me grow Dart's developer ecosystem (particularly interested in things outside of Flutter), by supporting or contributing to one of my projects like [Steward](https://github.com/PyreStudios/steward), [Bosun](https://github.com/PyreStudios/bosun), [Dwell](https://github.com/PyreStudios/dwell), or [Popshop](https://github.com/PyreStudios/popshop).

#### Talks

If I’m talking about something at a conference, event, or meetup, It’s probably something I’ve blogged about or am about to blog about. If you can learn something from me, I don’t believe you should have to listen to me talk about it when the internet offers a great medium for transcripts via my blog.

#### More Information Than You Could Possibly Want.

When I'm free from obligations, I try to spend time with my lovely wife and two dogs. I'll also find time to work on open source projects, my own personal projects, and am always trying to find the time to read more. If you’re near Louisville, Kentucky, let's go grab coffee and talk about what you're working on!
