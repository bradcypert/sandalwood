Iâ€™ve recorded a quick Youtube video for you! In this video, we walk through building
a simple URL shortener (think bit.ly) in PHP with the [Laravel ](https://laravel.com/)framework.

This originally started as part of my Laravel foundations course (link coming soon) but I felt that we could quickly get through an example on Youtube, too. In the course, we dive into things and go a bit slower to really get a grasp on how everything works, but this less than 30 minute video should get you started down the right path.

If you want to continue building upon this (and adding some JavaScript to the URL Shortener, too), definitely check out the course (link coming soon).
